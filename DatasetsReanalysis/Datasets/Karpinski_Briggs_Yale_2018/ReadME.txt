The data indicating which participants met which exclusion criteria is available on the following OSF page (osf.io/dbq9h/), 
A key for the SPSS file:

The "awareness" variable indicates general exclusion categories:
0 = excluded (1120 and 1027 did not follow instructions based on experimenter notes, 1173 and 1176 had low performance)
1 = completely unaware (this is the sample authors analyzed)
2 = objective aware only (indicated awareness on objective check, but not through debriefing)
3 = subjective aware only (did not indicate awareness on objective check, but did through debriefing)
4 = completely aware (objective and subjective)

The "explicitaware" variable indicates that when asked "Were you aware of the other stimulus?" during debriefing, the participant said:
1 = yes (excluded for subjective awareness)
2 = no (included in analyses)

The "pass" variables indicates objective awareness:
0 = above chance (over 60% trials correct)
1 = at chance

For computing objective awareness - Experimenters listened to the audio recording of participants' trials and coded responses where the 
participant accurately identified the suppressed stimulus (e.g. said "letters" when the primed equation was made of letters: a+b+c) as a
 1 and incorrectly identified the stimulus as a 0. The values were then averaged so that scores ranged from 0 to 1. As such, 0 = none identified
 correctly, 1 = all identified correctly, .5 = 50% chance of identifying correctly, etc.
    The OSF page includes a zipped folder of individual excel sheets for each participant. The awareness codes are recorded in column P, rows
 210-273. The audio recordings are not available on OSF.
